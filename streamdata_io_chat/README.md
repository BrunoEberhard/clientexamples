# streamdata.io and restdb.io chat example

This example requires that you have a streamdata.io account set up (and of course a restdb.io account as well).

To replicate this example for yourself, you should create a database with a simple collection named "Notifications" with two text fields: "message" and "nick".

The next step is to create a restdb.io "Page" in your database and paste the contents of the index.html file into it. You should change the URLs so that they point to your database. 

Note: To access the restdb.io Page externally, you need to have a Basic subscription.

Thanks to Bhaumik Patel for the [chat bootstrap template](http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/chat-widget).

Chat is only one example of live streaming data. The code for retrieving updated data using streamdata.io is identical for other scenarios.

Have fun!
